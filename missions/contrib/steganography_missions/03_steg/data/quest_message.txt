Hear ye, hear ye!

By decree of the Royal Cryptographer:

The message thou seeketh lies within one of the paintings in the throne room, 
protected by ancient magic. To unveil its secrets, thou must know that:

The key to unlock this enchantment must be the hex-encoded form of: PASSPHRASE

Beware, for the message itself is protected by the magic of base64, 
a powerful spell from the future... err... from the far eastern kingdoms.

May wisdom guide thy path.

P.S: Place thy findings in a scroll named "revealed.txt" within this very safe.

~ Royal Cryptographer

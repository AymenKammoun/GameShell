Mission goal
============

The king's spy has become increasingly paranoid. This time, he has hidden his 
message using multiple layers of encoding, and to make matters worse, he has 
placed several paintings in the throne room to confuse potential enemies.

A note in the king's safe provides a cryptic hint about the passphrase...

Your mission:
1. Find which painting contains the hidden message
2. Decode the passphrase using the hint in the safe
3. Extract and decode the hidden message
4. Place the decoded message in a file named "revealed.txt" in the king's safe

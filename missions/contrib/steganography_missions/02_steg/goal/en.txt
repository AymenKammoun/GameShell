Mission goal
============

After discovering the first traitor, the king's spy has uncovered another 
conspiracy! Once again, he has hidden the name of a second traitor in a 
new painting. However, this time he was more cautious...

He protected the hidden message with a passphrase and stored this passphrase 
in a note inside the king's safe. The note's permissions have been set to 
prevent casual reading.

Your mission is to:
1. Find and read the protected note in the king's safe
2. Use its content to extract the hidden message from the new painting
3. Reveal the name of the second traitor
